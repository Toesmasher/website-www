## Introduction

The first session saw our characters introduced, the party now consisting of:

- Solaria Mermidia Johnsson, the half-elven caspian bard looking for her sister.
- Zugorm the Powerful, the orc barbarian whose tribe lost a delerium artifact.
- Shallyshaska, the tiefling monk looking to preserve brewing techniques from Drakkenheim.
- Raz Do'kir, the dragonborn wild magic sorcerer who was outcast from the Amethyst Academy and now
  seeks access to the inscrutable tower.

## On the road

Solaria, Shallyshaska and Raz were hired for the time honored trope of escorting a caravan
somewhere. A particularly nasty bout of rain drove the group towards an abandoned barn to seek
shelter, where they were attacked by Zugorm who also sought shelter there. Solaria, having met
Zugorm before, averted any deeper conflict and introduced him to the party.

As the evening progressed the group was accosted by bandits who wanted a piece of the goods being
transported. The groups wasn't really having it, having passed two of the
persuasion/deception/intimidation checks to have them back off, they attacked instead. Solaria
dropped to a single hitpoint, but the group made it out alive while three of the bandits fled.

Nursing their wounds the group was a few hours later once again interrupted by another group of
adventurers on their way away from the city. While cautious, they allowed the group into the barn
and got some basic information about the city and the conditions therein. One of the travellers kept
his hood up and stayed silent, making the group curious about his condition, but not enough to
insist he take his hood off or notice that one of his arms was heavily mutated. In the middle of the
night the contamination got the better of the mutated adventurer which turned him into an insane
tentacled delerium dreg who attacked his own friends. The group intervened and killed the creature
with no casualties. The group offered to hold a small ceremony for the fallen adventurer, cremating
the remains and holding a short vigil. A nice touch!

Come morning the group, now including Zugorm, continued their trip to Emberwood Village.

## Emberwood Village

The group made several contacts in the village.

- Aldor the Immense was of course delighted at the sight of new customers. Raz/Ben in particular
  liked him.
- Solaria made contact with the Amethyst Academy via River at the Red Lion Hotel, she encouraged the
  group to show that they can survive in the city.
- Zugorm struck out alone and made friends with Blackjack Mel, who agreed to keep his eyes out for
  other orcs for him.
- The delerium traders in town informed the group about the delerium trade, and how several groups
  go in to town to find the crystals in order to sell them.

## Prospecting

The group decided to head into town to find delerium, both as a part of showing River that the group
could survive, as well as to make some money. After a few hours poking around in the south-eastern
area of the city they found something, unfortunately that something was guarded by a group of Haze
Husks. The group dispatched the husks, but it came at the cost Shallyshaska gaining a contamination
level, unfortunately he didn't mutate which would've been fun.

At the end of the session the group was ambushed by another group of adventurers as they were
gathering the delerium they found.
