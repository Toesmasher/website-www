## Session Zero complete

Session Zero has concluded! We're going to Drakkenheim with a party of four adventurers, each with
their own stories and ambitions.

## The players

- Susanne is playing Solaria Mermidia Johnsson, a half-elven bard from Caspia who was in Drakkenheim
  with her sister Luna when the meteor fell 20 years ago. The sisters got separated during the chaos
  and Solaria is now searching for clues of what became of her sister.

- Johnnie is Zugorm the Powerful, an orc barbarian who was born around the time the meteor fell. For
  the moment he's keeping to himself why he's in Drakkenheim, but he has met Solaria before and is
  on good terms with her.

- Ben is Raz Do'Kir, a dragonborn wild magic sorcerer who was ousted from the Amethyst Academy for
  his unsanctioned research into the exotic material known as delerium. He found refuge with the
  Queen's Men and is a low-level member of one of her gangs. He's still resentful of the Academy and
  seeks entry to the fallen Inscrutable Tower before they do to claim the knowledge there.

- Matt is playing Shallyshaska, a tiefling monk from an undisclosed faraway land. Being from an
  order known for their brewing, he seeks to collect what knowledge remains in Drakkenheim in order
  to preserve it, and maybe create something even better.

## Changes from last time

- Using tokens and maps will be a bit more held back this time in order to reduce the video-gamey
  bits a bit. The players are to describe more of what they're doing while a map might not be
  available.

- The tokens will no longer share their fields of vision. This is to have the players communicate a
  bit more, as well as to once again reduce the video-gameyness of it all.

- Because there is no character that can really fulfil the role of healer I gave the players a
  choice: You either get a bit more generous standard arrays for attributes, or healing potions will
  always heal for their maximum potential. They went for the attributes. Let's see if that comes
  back to bite me in the ass...

## Session one

Our very first session will be played on September 15! Need to prep the various materials and then
let's goooo!
