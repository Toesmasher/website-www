## Status

Due to some unfortunate scheduling the start of this campaign, or more specifically the end of the
currently running one, has been postponed with about a month. With 2, maybe 3, sessions left of the
current campaign I'm hopeful we can run session zero for Drakkenheim to set everyone up and be ready
to go as soon as possible. Session zero should kick of during the first week of september at latest.

## TODO for session zero

- Introduce all the characters. Currently it looks like the party will be composed of a barbarian,
  bard, monk, and sorcerer. Ensure there's no inherently unresolvable conflict among them severe
  enough to prevent them from being able to work as a group.

- Establish links between the characters. While everyone doesn't need to know everyone, it would
  help if some of them know others from before.

- Set initial inventories for everyone. Depending on backgrounds, they might have a few extras.

- Establish the setting, initial positions for everyone and an introduction adventure to
  Drakkenheim. The suggested intro adventure should do it, modified so that Johnnie gets his desired
  entry.

- Agree on rules to run by.
  - Because there's currently no character in the group that can fulfil the role of a primary healer
    I'm planning to offer two options to mitigate this a bit, pick ONE:
    - Either healing potions always heal for the maximum possible roll
    - A more generous standard array for attributes: 17 15 13 12 10 8
  - If Ben goes for the Wild Magic Sorcerer, the rules for when a surge occurs state that the DM
    *can* have you roll for a surge, which sounds... vague. Suggestion:
    - Roll a d20 on ANY qualifying spell cast. If you roll a 1, roll for a surge.
    - If tides of chaos has been expended, a surge occurs on a 1 or 2. Recharges tides if a surge
      occurs.
    - You can always intentionally cause a surge, but not to recharge tides of chaos.
  - Monks are not in a great place in the game. Maybe update the damage die for unarmed attacks by
    one? Or maybe provide a few extra ki points baseline?

- Establish things that will be run differently from the previous campaign
  - More group skill checks!

## TODO right after session zero

- Establish knowledge each character might have in private with each character

## Stuff that's been done so far

- All spells have been implemented in Foundry as a compendium.
- Nearly all the monsters have been implemented in Foundry as a compendium, a few legendary remain.

## Stuff left to do before session one

- Implement the legendary NPCs in a compendium.
- Implement the various NPCs specified outside the appendix as a compendium.
- Extract artwork from the book to use as visuals
- Make tokens of Zod's art
