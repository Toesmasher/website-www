## Intro

[Drakkenheim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPct8hlnXag), the thing that after some 20 or so years
of passively consuming DnD stuff finally pushed me to actually play!

This area will serve as my own logs for sessions in order to keep track on what's going on in the
campaign, the last campaign got sort of messy as I kept most of the notes in my head or spread
randomly over a notepad.

The game will be played in foundry, online, out of necessity due to the geographical spread of the
group.

As the campaign comes with a boatload of maps this suddenly frees up a lot of time as the previous
campaign demanded a lot of time spent with mapmaking on-the-fly. This frees up time to plan the
as-of-yet unnamed campaign which will take place in a less generic europe-ish fantasy environemnt;
The tropics and the seas!

## The Players

The players for this campaign consists of a cross-atlantic group, most of which are returning
players from the previous campaign. I've asked everyone to come up with at least two high-level
character concepts they'd like to play.

**Ben** - My new 'murican friend who played the ranger (Beast Master) Fizzilean and is a veteran
tabletopper. As far as I know he's currently aiming to play a draconic lineage sorcerer this time
around, which should fit in nicely, though I might try to nudge him towards a wild magic sorcerer
as that would open up a lot of story possibilities.

**Johnnie** - My old swedish friend who played his very first campaign at my table as a fighter
(Rune Knight) named Lysgiel. He seems to want to keep his frontliner-role, so I've recommended a few
alternatives that can fulfil a similar role. A Barbarian or Paladin of some sort would be fun, or
just a different kind of Fighter. Then again, he wanted to play a wizard last time, so who knows?

**Matt** - I haven't yet talked to this guy, but he's a friend of Ben so that's a good start. The
only thing I really know right now is that he'd like to play some sort of war priest.

**Susanne** - The bestest friend and another first-time player, who previously played the rogue
(Arcane Trickster) Id√∫n. This time she's leaning towards a bard or a ranger, with a preference
towards the bard. We've already brainstormed some ideas for the bard and I really like it, so I hope
she gets to play it.

The details will be hammered out during session zero, which I expect to start some time in August.

## Planned changes

I'd like to tweak a few rules and clarify a few things, nothing big.

- Taking the help action when another character is doing a skill check will require that both
  characters are proficient in the skill. This serves two purposes;

  - It prevents almost all skill checks from being made with advantage every time, as most of the
    time outside of combat whenever a character performs a skill check the others aren't using
    their actions.
  - Having multiple characters with overlapping proficiencies are no longer a waste, and may instead
    be a gain.

- Skill check DCs will be set depending on how specific the check is. In a room with a secret door,
  just saying "I want to search the room" will be less likely to reveal it than "I want to search
  for hidden passages near the western wall". Of course, the second one may not reveal the crossbow
  trap rigged to the door...

- Identifying items can now be done over a short rest, this is a rule I sort of missed my first time
  over. I'm interpreting this as characters basically playing around with items in order to figure
  out what they do. This may mean that through this process they can *partially* identify items, but
  may not have discovered all there is to it. Players will be notified if there's something else
  to the item.

- When it comes to spellcasting, it is to my knowledge *never* possible to expend two spell slots in
  a single round to cast multiple spells, apparantly I sucked at communicating this in a good way.
  What *is* allowed is to cast a bonus action spell, followed by a cantrip (which does not expend a
  spell slot). This also allows a sorcerer with the quicken spell metamagic to turn an action spell
  to a bonus action spell in order to fit a cantrip in there too. As far as I know, the only allowed
  way to expend multiple spell slots during a single turn is by classes who can turn spell slots
  into effects that aren't actually spells. A paladin can, for instance, cast a bonus action spell
  and follow that up with attacks which may expend spell slots for smite.

- Monster tactics. During the first campaign I intentionally ran monsters as rather stupid, most of
  the time this fit in-universe as most monsters were described as just plain stupid, or too filled
  with bloodlust to care. I'm going to change this now as everyone knows how to play, the opposition
  will be smarter when it makes sense in-universe.

## Things to be better at

- Check concentration! If I had a nickle for every time I forgot to check concentration, for both
  players and monsters, I'd have... a lot of currency with no local relevance, but still.

- Itemization. Mistakes were made...

## TODO

- Create compendiums in foundry for the Drakkenheim-specific NPCs, monsters and spells.
- Create compendium in foundry for the starting scenes of the campaigns. Not necessarily full
  setups, but import the maps and see if additional maps are needed.
- Prep for the introduction on June 7.
